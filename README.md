Usage:

Ensure you have Go installed on your system.

Save the code to a file named main.go.

Open a terminal and run the scanner with the target URL as an argument:

shell
Copy code
go run main.go https://example.com
Replace https://example.com with the URL of the web application you want to scan.

The program will scan the specified web application for common vulnerabilities and report any findings.

Please note that this is a basic vulnerability scanner for educational purposes. Real-world vulnerability scanning tools are much more sophisticated and typically require careful configuration and permission from the target site owner. Always use security tools responsibly and within the bounds of the law and ethical guidelines.
